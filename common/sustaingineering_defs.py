# So, here's the thing: With a CAN bus, we can't just send JSON messages -- Each message has to fit in 6 bytes. That
# means we have to be efficient about things. That being said, it would be GREAT to just assign to things like they're
# a dictionary. That's why I wrote the property_advertiser library: With the property advertiser, you can just assign
# to your sensor's "properties" like they're a dictionary, and they will end up on the other devices. The PROBLEM with
# this is that each device has to be speaking the same language -- They need to know what the binary messages mean in
# order to populate the common, shared dictionary. Hence, the goal of the code below is to:

# 1. Provide some support code so we can use the same codebase on multiple devices
# 2. Define which IDs we want to use to communicate, software versions, time intervals, and other constants
# 3. Define the properties we want to use. We create a custom PropertyRegistry and add our desired properties to it
# 4. Finally, we define common "main" code for our devices that sets up the property registry and CAN bus

# The reserved bits of the ID are required to be ones. The bits are reserved in case we need to send different CAN
# messages on the same bus or something.
# The final device ID is reserved for status messages. The reason for this is because CAN IDs that are larger have a
# larger priority, so status messages will have the greatest priority.

# These are assigned manually below on a per-feather basis, EXCEPT for the status ID. See the rationale above.
